## Install
Be sure to go into options.txt in your .minecraft folder and set "pauseOnLostFocus" to "false"
Must be done with Minecraft closed
To access your .minecraft folder, open explorer and paste this into the address bar: `%appdata%\.minecraft`

Alternatively, you can also do F3 + P in game until it says "Pause on lost focus: disabled"

## To Use:
Line yourself up for whatever action you want to take and then bring up the menu. Go into the application and click "Start".

Once you click start, you will have 3 seconds to go into the game and exit the menu. When the countdown hits 0, the program will run and will auto tab you out of the game.

When you want to stop, click "Stop" and it will stop the action.
